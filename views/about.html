<p>The web is my canvas, the computer is my medium.</p>

<p>I am hesitant to try new foods and cringe at the thought of playing a rough sport, but I am fearless when it comes to software engineering. I am eager to learn new technologies and challenge my thinking&mdash;even if that technology looks green and unfamiliar like basil on a pizza. Additionally, I am not afraid to fail. Although I may get hit by “dodge balls” throughout the learning process, I view failure as an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Here’s a little peak into my educational and professional journey so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I am currently a software engineer at <a href="http://www.demandware.com/">Demandware</a> in Burlington, MA working mainly in Angular to develop their cloud e-commerce platform.</li>
	<li>I graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor of science in computer science and a minor in business administration in May 2015. I still have a lot to learn, but I completed my studies with an ability to reason, solve, and persist.</li>
	<li>I belonged to a university research lab, the <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/">Engaging Computing Group</a>, for 3 years of my undergraduate career on the <a href="https://isenseproject.org/">iSENSE Project</a>. I joined in 2012 as a QA engineer and later settled into release management. I served as a bridge between many teams&mdash;web, mobile, API, and educational. I embraced both the technical and communicative aspects of this role, and I got really good at source control.</li>
	<li>I spent 4 months of summer 2014 working at a tiny powerhouse, <a href="https://www.uie.com">User Interface Engineering (UIE)</a>, in North Andover, MA as a front-end web developer <a href="https://www.uie.com/meet-the-interns">intern</a>. My responsibilities were mainly technical&mdash;building web pages, working with the MailChimp API, as well as writing and executing QA test plans&mdash;but I was immersed in the world of design simply by “osmosis.” I worked alongside brilliant UX experts including Jared Spool.</li>
	<li>I continued my relationship with the wonderful folks at UIE throughout my senior year of college as a QA contract engineer. I wrote and executed more QA test plans to help the company in sustaining their bug-free and delightful conference websites for many years to come.</li>
</ul>
<h4>My long-term dream goes beyond technology.</h4>
<p>My long-term dream is to work at the intersection of technology and leadership. Although I like working hands-on with technology as an engineer, I believe that my true bliss (and greatest strength) is being a leader.</p>
<p>I think there is something to be said about working in an environment where people are encouraged to excel, embrace learning, and, most importantly, enjoy coming to every day. Simply put, I aspire to be in a position to lead people in doing great things while loving and thriving every second of it.</p>
